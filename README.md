# Pet Adoption App

Welcome to the **Pet Adoption App**, a Flutter application designed for discovering adorable pets and helping them find their forever homes. The app uses **Flutter BLoC** for state management and adheres to the **SLID (Separation of Logic, Interface, and Data)** principles for a clean and maintainable architecture.

## Tech Stack
